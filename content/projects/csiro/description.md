During my research internship at CSIRO, I worked closely with supervision of ML researchers to investigate and improve an (at the time) new setting of Object Detection proposed by [Li et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15353). By the end my improvements were at best incremental, but the experience of scientific research and communication is something I highly value.

**The Project** As illustrated above, the setting only has 1 instance of each type annotated. For example, only 1 human is annotated, although there are many humans in the image. I attempted to find improvements in the original method proposed by Li et al. (2022). I applied concepts proposed in other settings, such as Negative Learning and Memory Banks.

**Tech Stack** Expanding upon the source code available in the aforementioned paper, I coded in Python using the PyTorch library.
