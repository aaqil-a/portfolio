I led and worked with a team of fellow students at the Australian National University (ANU) to develop an artistic data visualisation web app. It was made for a year-long project at the ANU, where students worked with real world clients to deliver a product. I had the role of Project Manager during this time.

**The App**
The web app visualises metadata from a portrait dataset, such as charts showing the age of the subjects. Visually, the charts are comprised of portraits that make up their respective category.  For example, there's a bar chart that shows the age distribution of the dataset. The 15 - 30 year old bar is visually made of all the portraits of subjects within that age range. The app is also interactive with zooming, panning, animations, and intuitive navigation for use in public art exhibitions.

**Tech Stack**
The app was developed in TypeScript using the Svelte front-end framework, and the visuals were made mainly using the [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/) library. A development server with CI/CD was hosted using GitLab and an AWS EC2 instance.
